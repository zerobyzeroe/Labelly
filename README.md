# Labelly

An Image Caption Generator App

- An End-to-End Python App to captionize images.
- Implemented an Encoder-Decoder Framework Using the Xception model as Encoder and Bidirectional LSTM as decoder.
- Performed NLP techniques like NLTK to preprocess text data, Encoder takes images to extract features and decoder captionizes them.
- The results were acceptable with the BLEU score >.5.
- Developed a UI using Streamlit which takes Images as input and returns the caption.

# For smooth running of app.py server as frontend, here's the trained model just download and run the server:
