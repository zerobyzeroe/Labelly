An Image Caption Generator App

An End-to-End Python App to captionize images. 
Implemented an Encoder-Decoder Framework Using Xception as Encoder and Bidirectional LSTM as decoder. Performed NLP techniques like NLTK to preprocess text data Encoder takes images to extract features and decoder captionize them. The results were acceptable with the BLEU score >.5. Created an UI using streamlit which takes Image as input and returns the caption.
